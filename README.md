# AI-Team SDLC — Agentic Software Delivery System

![From idea to production, delivered by an agentic team](docs/demo/ai-team-idea-to-prod.png)

> **▶ [View the live executive presentation](https://devopsabcs-engineering.github.io/ai-team-sdlc/demo/ai-sdlc-lifecycle.html)** — an interactive, animated walkthrough of the whole agentic lifecycle (published via GitHub Pages). Prefer a static view? See the [high-resolution poster](docs/demo/ai-sdlc-lifecycle-poster.png).

A reusable, spec-agnostic **agentic SDLC**, packaged as a **GitHub Copilot plugin**: a master
orchestrator turns any product idea or spec into shipped software by decomposing the work into
verifiable tasks, dispatching each to the right specialist AI agent, enforcing quality gates,
keeping a resumable record of progress, and reporting `DONE` only when every task passes its
gate — with one human governance sign-off.

It is **portable** across VS Code Copilot and the Copilot CLI. The team ships as `ait-` specialist
agents and skills; their shared operating contract travels with them in the `ait-conventions`
skill, so the system behaves identically in any repo that installs the plugin.

## The lifecycle

```
ideate → prototype (UI only) → PRD → spec → implement → test (QA + critic + security)
       → human sign-off → deploy
```

Every stage is owned by an AI agent (namespaced `ait-`) with humans in the loop, and a single
mandatory human governance sign-off before deploy.

## Install (Copilot plugin)

Install from the marketplace, then enable the plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add devopsabcs-engineering/ai-team-sdlc
copilot plugin install ai-team-sdlc@ai-team-sdlc
```

Already installed? Pull the latest agents, skills, and prompts:

```bash
copilot plugin update ai-team-sdlc@ai-team-sdlc
```

That's it — the team works immediately. The orchestrator auto-creates its runtime tracking store
on the first run, so **no setup step is required**.

Optionally, make adoption explicit in a repo with the one-time `ait-init` skill (it enables the
plugin declaratively, drops a thin `AGENTS.md` pointer, and git-ignores the tracking store — it
never copies the agents or skills into your repo):

```bash
copilot -p "Use the ait-init skill to set up this repo"
```

> **The path:** install the plugin → *(optional)* run `ait-init` → the repo is an agentic SDLC workspace.

## Why it wins

- **One team, idea to production.** A single orchestrator drives ideation, prototyping, specs, build, test, sign-off, and deploy — no hand-offs lost between tools.
- **Quality gates on every task.** AI-authored code passes the *same* build, lint, unit, acceptance, critic-review, and security gates as human code. A task is `DONE` only when every required gate passes.
- **Resumable by design.** Runs persist canonical state, skip finished work, recover from crashes, and never redo what's done — so long jobs survive interruptions.
- **One human governance sign-off.** Product Owner, Security, and Tech Lead approve before deploy; agents never self-approve. Control without micromanaging.
- **Portable.** Install once; it works across VS Code Copilot and the Copilot CLI, in any repo, with zero in-repo duplication.
- **Transparent.** Every decision and file change is tracked in an auditable, append-only history.

## The AI agents at a glance

| Agent | Role | Phase | Invoke via |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ait-sdlc-orchestrator` | Decomposes work, dispatches specialists, enforces gates, reports `DONE` | All | `/product-run` |
| `ait-product-designer` | User journeys, UX flows, wireframes, clickable prototype | Plan | `/product-design`, `/product-prototype`, `/product-showcase` |
| `ait-product-owner` | PRD, acceptance criteria, scope and priorities | Plan | `/product-specs` |
| `ait-architect` | Architecture, API contracts, data models, technical specs | Plan | `/product-specs` |
| `ait-backend-dev` | Server logic, APIs, data, persistence, backend tests | Build | `/product-implement` |
| `ait-frontend-dev` | UI, client state, routes, accessibility, frontend tests | Build | `/product-implement` |
| `ait-qa-test` | Test plans, acceptance verification, regression evidence | Test | `/product-qa` |
| `ait-code-reviewer` | Critical review for blocking correctness and maintainability defects | Test | `/product-review` |
| `ait-security-rai` | Secrets, SAST, dependency/SCA, and Responsible-AI validation | Test | `/product-security` |
| `ait-devops` | Release, deployment, rollback planning (after sign-off) | Deploy | `/product-deploy` |
| `ait-scribe` | Consolidates decisions and file-change history | All | *(automatic)* |

Two more skills underpin the team: **`ait-conventions`** (the shared contract — tracking store,
task schema, gates, resumability, sign-off) and **`ait-quality-gates`** (the reusable gate library).

## Commands (phases → skills)

| Command | Skill | Specialist agent |
|---|---|---|
| `/product-design` | `ait-product-design` | Product Designer |
| `/product-prototype` | `ait-product-prototype` | Product Designer |
| `/product-showcase` | `ait-product-showcase` | Product Designer |
| `/product-specs` | `ait-tech-specs` | Product Owner, Architect |
| `/product-implement` | `ait-implementation` | Backend / Frontend Dev |
| `/product-qa` | `ait-qa-validation` | QA / Test |
| `/product-review` | `ait-review-critic` | Code Reviewer / Critic |
| `/product-security` | `ait-security` | Security / RAI |
| `/product-deploy` | `ait-deploy` | DevOps |
| `/product-run` | `ait-sdlc-orchestrate` | Orchestrator + Scribe |

The `/product-*` commands are VS Code Copilot slash-command wrappers. In the Copilot CLI, invoke
the underlying `ait-*` skill directly (below).

## Building prototypes

The Plan phase has two complementary prototyping stages, both driven by the Product Designer.
Every prototype is a **static, self-contained HTML site with vanilla CSS/JS** — no framework and
no build step — so it opens in any browser and is easy to share.

| Stage | Command · skill | Use it to |
|---|---|---|
| Lightweight spike | `/product-prototype` · `ait-product-prototype` | De-risk a UX flow with a quick clickable spike before writing a spec. |
| Executive showcase | `/product-showcase` · `ait-product-showcase` | Produce a polished, presentation-ready prototype — generated from text/specs, or faithfully reproduced from an existing visual design. |

The showcase stage composes more skills as needed: `ait-wireframe-to-frontend` (faithfully reproduce
wireframes, mockups, a Figma export, or a PDF), plus `frontend-design` and `theme-factory` for visual
craft. Reach for a framework only on explicit request — the default output stays static HTML.

### Copilot CLI

```bash
# Quick clickable spike to de-risk a flow (static HTML + vanilla CSS/JS)
copilot -p "Use the ait-product-prototype skill to prototype the onboarding flow in ./specs/onboarding.md"

# Executive showcase generated from a written spec
copilot -p "Use the ait-product-showcase skill to build an executive showcase prototype from ./specs/checkout.md"

# Faithfully reproduce an existing visual design as a clickable frontend
copilot -p "Use the ait-wireframe-to-frontend skill to reproduce ./design/dashboard.png as a static HTML prototype"
```

### VS Code Copilot

```text
/product-prototype                                → clickable spike (uses ${file}/${selection})
/product-showcase   ./specs/checkout.md           → executive showcase from a spec
/product-showcase   reproduce ./design/dashboard.png  → faithful reproduction of a visual design
```

## Using the team

The same `ait-*` skills and agents power all three surfaces — only the invocation gesture differs.

### Copilot CLI

```bash
# One-time: install the plugin
copilot plugin marketplace add devopsabcs-engineering/ai-team-sdlc
copilot plugin install ai-team-sdlc@ai-team-sdlc

# Full lifecycle from a spec (folder, file, or pasted idea)
copilot -p "Use the ait-sdlc-orchestrate skill. Specs: ./specs/. Run the full SDLC and report DONE."

# Resume an interrupted run (nothing finished is redone)
copilot -p "Use the ait-sdlc-orchestrate skill. Resume run .copilot-tracking/2026-07-22-checkout/."

# Single phase — call the matching skill directly
copilot -p "Use the ait-product-design skill to shape UX flows for ./specs/checkout.md"
copilot -p "Use the ait-product-prototype skill to build and verify a clickable prototype from ./specs/checkout.md"
copilot -p "Use the ait-tech-specs skill to turn the approved prototype into API contracts + acceptance criteria"
copilot -p "Use the ait-implementation skill to build task T-003 from .copilot-tracking/<run>/tasks.md"
copilot -p "Use the ait-qa-validation skill to verify acceptance criteria for the checkout feature"

# Optional: wire the plugin into a fresh repo (settings + AGENTS.md pointer + gitignored tracking)
copilot -p "Use the ait-init skill to set up this repo"
```

### VS Code Copilot

Run a `/product-*` slash command in Copilot Chat; each is a thin router that loads the matching
skill and persona. Input comes from the text after the command, the current selection
(`${selection}`), or the open file (`${file}`).

```text
/product-run        ./specs/checkout.md         → full lifecycle, pauses for sign-off
/product-design     a mobile checkout flow      → ideation: journeys, UX flows, tokens
/product-prototype                              → clickable prototype (uses ${file}/${selection})
/product-specs                                  → PRD + API contracts + acceptance criteria
/product-implement                              → build the next ready task
/product-qa    ·    /product-review    ·    /product-security
/product-deploy                                 → release (after human sign-off)
```

Or open the agent picker and choose a persona directly (e.g. **ait-sdlc-orchestrator**,
**ait-product-designer**, **ait-backend-dev**) and describe the task in your own words.

### Copilot app / coding agent

Enable the plugin once — from the plugin manager (add marketplace `devopsabcs-engineering/ai-team-sdlc`, then
install), or declaratively in `.github/copilot/settings.json`:

```json
{ "enabledPlugins": ["ai-team-sdlc@ai-team-sdlc"] }
```

Then just describe the goal in a session — skills activate by description, no slash command needed:

```text
Take ./specs/checkout.md through the full SDLC and stop for sign-off before deploy.
Prototype the onboarding screen, then review it for accessibility issues.
```
